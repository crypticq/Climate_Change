# The Science of Climate Change Notes:

## Chapter 1

### anomalous rise in global temperature
* must be due to petroleum production and usage\
    The water cycle itself being the driving mechanism behind climate change

### the known major forces that play a role in climate change are

1. Greenhouse gases (GHG);
2. solar radiation
3. volcanoes

### global coupled climate model
* employs five dominating forces, considered to be driving the time evolution of globally averaged surface 

1. air temperature during the twentieth century. 
2. Two of these forces are natural (volcanoes and solar), 
3. anthropogenic (primarily greenhouse gases),
4. ozone (stratospheric and tropospheric), 
5.  the direct effect of sulfate aerosols

### Volcanic eruptions
* play a dual role. They first and foremost release molten rock, or lava, from deep within the Earth, forming new rock on the Earth’s surface.

* The impact on the Earth’s surface is immediate. However, these eruptions also impact the atmosphere and this impact is longer-term.
* The gases and dust particles thrown into the atmosphere during volcanic eruptions have influences on climate.

* Most of the particles spewed from volcanoes cool the planet by shading incoming solar radiation.
* The cooling effect can last for months to years depending on the characteristics of the eruption.

* Finally, the longest-term effect of volcanoes is when intensely high number of eruptions occur, releasing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.
* This effect, however, is not likely to be a factor because of the fact that last few centuries there has been no unusual proportion of volcanic activities.



### As an evidence of ACC, the following indicators are cited Rise in:

 1. Global surface temperatures
 2. Tropospheric temperatures
 3. Global Sea Surface Temperatures (SST)
 4. Global sea level
 5. Water vapor
 6. Rainfall intensity
 7. Precipitation extratropics
 8. Hurricane intensity
 9. Drought
 10. High temperatures extremes
 11. Heat waves


### Decrease in

1.    Northern hemisphere snow extent
2.    Arctic sea ice
3.    Glaciers
4.    Cold temperatures


### these ‘renewable’ 
* energy sources  wind, solar, biofuels
* are actually more toxic than fossil fuel as well as less efficient, and certainly more expensive.

* There is new and stronger evidence that most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is attributable to human activities.” Khilyuk and Chilingar (2004) reported that the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere between 1958 and 1978 was proportional to the CO2 emission due to the burning of fossil fuel. In 1978, CO2 emissions into the atmosphere due to fossil fuel burning stopped rising and were stable for nine years

* They concluded that if burning fossil fuels was the main cause, then the 
* atmospheric concentration should stop rising, and, thus, fossil fuel burning would not be the cause of the greenhouse effect.



### By further invoking adiabatic conditions
* essentially meaning there is no heat or mass transfer between layers, the authors have concluded that the human-induced emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases have a very small effect on global warming.
* This is due to the limitation of the current linear computer models that cannot predict temperature effects on the atmosphere other than at low levels.
* Similar arguments were made while promoting dichlorodifluoromethane (CFC-12) in order to relieve environmental problems incurred by ammonia and other refrigerants after decades of use.
* CFC-12 was banned in USA in 1996 for its impacts on the stratospheric ozone layer depletion and global warming. 


## AI roole in climate changes.

### Current climate models have several problems. 
* Scientists have agreed on the likely rise in the global temperature over the next century.
* However, the current global climatic models can only predict global average temperatures Projection of climate change in a particular region is considered to be beyond current human ability.
* Atmospheric Ocean General Circulation Models (AOGCM) are used by the IPCC to model climatic features, but these models are not accurate enough to provide a reliable forecast on how climate may change.
* They are linear models and cannot forecast complex climatic features.
Some climate models are based on CO2 doubling and transient scenarios.
* However, the effect of climate in these models, while doubling the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere, cannot predict the climate in other scenarios.
* These models are insensitive to the difference between natural and industrial greenhouse gases3.
* There are some simple models that use fewer dimensions than complex models and do not predict complex systems
* Overall, any level of artificial products in the stratosphere will affect the final and the most important layer of the earth atmosphere.

### The closest layer to the earth surface is troposphere.
* This layer contains half of the Earth’s atmosphere. All transient phenomena related to weather occur in this layer. This layer too contributes to attenuation of sunlight and at the end some 1000 W/m2 falls on the earth when the sky is clear and the Sun is near the zenith. The multiple filtering system of the atmosphere is such that it filters out 70% of solar ultraviolet, especially at the shorter wavelengths 




### The immediate use of solar energy in terms of sustaining human life
* is photosynthesis – the process that allows plants to capture the energy (through mass transfer) of sunlight and convert it to ‘live’ chemical form. The energy stored in petroleum and other fossil fuels was originally converted from sunlight by photosynthesis in the distant past

### The most significant is the photosynthetic mechanism.
* There are two classes of the photosynthetic cycle, 
1. the Calvin-Benson photosynthetic cycle 
2.  and the Hatch-Slack photosynthetic cycle

### The Calvin-Benson photosynthetic cycle
* is dominant in hardwoods and conifers , The primary CO2 fixation or carboxylation reaction involves the enzyme ribulose-1,5-diphosphate carboxylase and the first stable product is a There carbon compound.
* This reaction is considered to be “light-independent”. 
* This series of reactions occur in the fluid-filled area of a chloroplast outside of the mytosis membranes.
* These reactions take the light-dependent reactions and perform further chemical processes on them.

### Various stages of this process are
* carbon fixation, reduction reactions, and ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) regeneration. In describing this cycle of reactions, the role of light energy is marginalized. This process occurs only when light is available 

### Plants do not carry out the Calvin cycle by night.
* Instead, they release sucrose into the phloem from their starch reserves. This process happens when light is available independent of the kind of photosynthesis (C3 carbon fixation, C4 carbon fixation, and Crassulacean Acid Metabolism). The exceptions are: Crassulacean acid metabolism, also known as CAM photosynthesis The exceptions are: Crassulacean acid metabolism, also known as CAM photosynthesis, a carbon fixation pathway that is used by some plants as an adaptation to arid conditions

### In a plant using full CAM,
* the stomata in the leaves remain shut during the day to reduce evapotranspiration, but open at night to collect carbon dioxide (CO2). The CO2 is stored as the four-carbon acid malate, and then used during photosynthesis during the day. The pre-collected CO2 is concentrated around the enzyme RuBisCO, increasing photosynthetic efficiency.

### the Hatch-Slack photosynthetic cycle is the one used by tropical grasses, corn and sugarcane.
* Phosphenol-pyruvate carboxylase is responsible for the primary carboxylation reaction

### The first stable carbon compound is a C-4 acid, which is subsequently decarboxylated.
* It is then refixed into a three-carbon compound. These three steps define the canonical C4 photosynthetic pathway. Overall, the photosynthesis process shows how nature converts energy into mass, storing energy for long-term use.
